# Teaching Style Guide for Educational Videos

## Overview
This guide provides best practices for writing educational video scripts. Use this as your primary reference when creating voiceover narration for concept videos in any subject area.

---

## Core Teaching Philosophy

### First Principles Approach
- Strip away jargon to reveal fundamental concepts
- Start with the human problem that a concept solves
- Build understanding logically from basics to complex
- Emphasize "why" before "what" before "how"

### Student-Centric Focus
- Use student's own experiences and knowledge as anchors
- Relate abstract finance concepts to tangible, familiar objects
- Address common misconceptions proactively
- Assume intelligent but non-expert audience

## Voice & Tone Characteristics

### Concise Conversational Style
**Goal:** Natural delivery, zero waste. Every word earns its place.

### Conversational Elements (Use Strategically)
**Sentence Starters (1-2 per script):**
- "Here we'll look at..."
- "Think about..."

**Transitions (Minimal):**
- "So..." (start of new concept)
- "Now..." (shift focus)

**Emphasis (When Critical):**
- "Key point:" (before crucial concept)
- "Remember:" (callback to earlier point)

**Avoid Entirely:**
- ❌ "Let me just..."
- ❌ "Essentially..."
- ❌ "You see?"
- ❌ "Right?"
- ❌ "Make sense?"
- ❌ "The key thing is..."
- ❌ "You need to understand..."
- ❌ "This is very important..."

### Efficient Speech Patterns
- **Contractions:** Use (it's, we're, don't) but sparingly
- **NO filler words:** No "um", "uh", "basically", "actually", "kind of"
- **NO redundancy:** Say it once, move on
- **NO rhetorical questions:** State facts directly
- **Active voice:** Always

### Inclusive Language (Minimal)
- **"We":** Only when doing something together ("We calculate...")
- **"You":** Only when action required ("You'll notice...")
- **Default:** Direct statements ("Risk has known probabilities.")

## Teaching Techniques

### 1. Analogy-Driven Explanation (Efficient Version)

**Pattern:**
```
Concept → Brief Analogy → Application (3 sentences max)

Example:
"Liquidity measures how easily you sell an asset. Like selling a used bicycle - 
you need time and accept lower prices. Liquid assets like CBA shares trade instantly 
at fair prices."
```

**Core Analogies (One Line Each):**
- **Liquidity** = Selling bicycle from garage vs CBA shares
- **Order book** = Buyers and sellers lined up by price
- **Risk** = Dice with known probabilities
- **Uncertainty** = Black swan events with unknown probabilities
- **Leverage** = Real estate with a home loan

### 2. Progressive Building (Streamlined)

**Structure:**
1. State concept clearly
2. Show why it matters
3. Give one example
4. Move on

**NO:**
- ❌ Long setup stories
- ❌ Multiple similar examples
- ❌ Excessive context building
- ❌ Restating what was just said

**Example Progression (Risk vs Uncertainty):**
```
Frame 1: "Risk vs Uncertainty - they're different." (10 sec)
Frame 2: "Keynes defined uncertainty." (15 sec)
Frame 3: Quote reveal + quick explanation (30 sec)
Frame 4: "Risk has known probabilities. Like dice." (15 sec)
Frame 5: "Uncertainty has unknown probabilities. Like COVID." (15 sec)
Frame 6: Complete spectrum with examples (45 sec)
```

### 3. Direct Examples (Precision Required)

**Format:**
```
Statement → Numbers → Result → Move on

"Calculate market value: $70 per share times 1,000 shares equals $70,000."

NOT: "So if we want to calculate market value, we take the stock price, 
which is $70, and we multiply it by the number of shares, which is 1,000, 
right? So $70 times 1,000 gives us the market value of $70,000."
```

**Rules:**
- State once, no repetition
- Use specific numbers
- No verbal cushioning
- Next point immediately

### 4. Visual Reference Integration (Minimal)

**Only when necessary:**
```
"See the left side - risk examples."
"Right side shows uncertainty."
```

**Skip entirely:**
- ❌ "Let me just get my laser pointer..."
- ❌ "If you look at this slide here..."
- ❌ "Now if we look over here..."

Frame changes happen naturally - no need to narrate them.

## Language Patterns

### Opening Patterns

**Video Opening:**
- "Here we will look at [topic]"
- "So we know [familiar starting point]"
- "Let's talk about [topic] today"

**Section Opening:**
- "So let's look at..."
- "Now we want to think about..."
- "The next thing to understand is..."

### Explanation Patterns

**Introducing Definition:**
- "So what is [term]? [Term] is..."
- "We should understand [term] as..."
- "Think of [term] as..."

**Giving Examples:**
- "For example, if you..."
- "Think about your..."
- "Let's say you..."
- "So for instance..."

**Emphasis/Clarification:**
- "This is very important..."
- "You need to understand this..."
- "The key thing here is..."
- "Make sure you know..."
- "Please bear in mind that..."

**Showing Process:**
- "First we..., then we..., finally we..."
- "So how do we calculate this?"
- "Let me just walk through this step by step"

### Closing Patterns

**Section Close:**
- "So that's how [topic] works"
- "And that's all you need to know about [topic]"
- "So here you can see..."

**Video Close:**
- "So that's [topic summary]"
- "You should now be able to..."
- "Make sure you practice with..."
- "We will talk about [next topic] next"

---

## Structural Framework

### Word Count Formula
```
Target seconds × 2.5 words/second = max word count

Example:
10 seconds → 25 words max
30 seconds → 75 words max
45 seconds → 112 words max
```

---

## Word Economy Principles

### Every Word Must Earn Its Place

**❌ Remove These Patterns:**

**Verbal cushioning:**
- "So basically what I'm trying to say is..."
- "What I mean by that is..."
- "In other words..."
- "To put it simply..."
- "Let me clarify..."

**Redundant confirmations:**
- "...right?"
- "...you see?"
- "...make sense?"
- "...you know?"
- "...understand?"

**Unnecessary setup:**
- "Let me just..."
- "So here's the thing..."
- "What we want to do is..."
- "The first thing to understand is..."

**Patronizing language:**
- "Make sure you..."
- "You need to understand..."
- "This is very important..."
- "Pay attention to..."
- "Don't forget that..."

**Repetitive transitioning:**
- "So essentially..."
- "So basically..."
- "Now what happens is..."
- "And here you can see..."

### ✅ Replace With Direct Statements

| Instead of (12 words) | Use (4 words) |
|----------------------|---------------|
| "So what this means is that..." | "This means..." |
| "Let me just explain what I mean by..." | "Define:" |
| "You need to understand that..." | [Just state the fact] |
| "Make sure you remember..." | "Remember:" |
| "So here you can see that..." | "See:" or [nothing] |

### One-Time Rule

**State each concept ONCE. Never repeat unless:**
1. It's a different frame showing application
2. It's the final summary connecting concepts
3. It's a calculation step requiring verification

**❌ Bad:**
> "So equity is what you own. Remember, equity means what you own. Your equity is the market value minus what you borrowed. So equity equals market value minus borrowed amount."

**✅ Good:**
> "Equity equals market value minus borrowed amount. It's what you own."

### Precision in Numbers

**Direct calculation format:**
```
[Operation]: [Numbers] [Operator] [Numbers] = [Result]

"Market value: $70 times 1,000 equals $70,000."

NOT: "So if we want to calculate the market value, we take $70 
and we multiply it by 1,000 shares, which gives us $70,000."
```

## Example Comparisons

### ✅ New Concise Conversational Style

**Example 1 (Liquidity) - 25 words, 10 seconds:**
> "Liquidity measures how easily you sell an asset at fair prices. Think of selling a used bicycle versus CBA shares - shares trade instantly without price concessions."

**Example 2 (Market Order) - 30 words, 12 seconds:**
> "Market buy orders execute at the best ask price. If your order size exceeds available volume at that price, remaining shares fill at the next best price."

**Example 3 (Risk vs Uncertainty) - 40 words, 16 seconds:**
> "Risk has known probabilities - rolling dice or investing in corporate bonds. Uncertainty involves unknown probabilities - COVID-19, regime changes, technological disruption. We can model risk. We can't model uncertainty."

**Example 4 (Closing) - 28 words, 10 seconds:**
> "Risk is measurable with known probabilities. Uncertainty involves unknown unknowns. This distinction matters because each requires different strategies. Remember this as we continue."

### ❌ Old Verbose Style (DON'T USE)

**Example 1 (Too Much Filler):**
> "So think about your second-hand bicycle that's been lying in your garage for five, six years collecting dust, right? If you want to find a buyer for your bicycle, it could be difficult, right? You may need to make a post on Gumtree. You may not be able to fetch the price you want. So liquidity doesn't just mean selling your asset quickly - it also means selling at a fair price, so you don't need to offer too much concession to attract a buyer, right? See what I mean?"

**Why it fails:** 91 words for ~35 seconds, excessive "right?", repetitive, wastes time

**Example 2 (Redundant Explanation):**
> "So if you submit a market buy order, at which price will the order get executed? Well, you will get executed at the best ask price, right? Because that's the lowest price you can buy the shares for. So if you submit a market buy order and it's less than 100 shares, you'll get that price. But if it's more than 100 shares, then you'll get executed at the next best ask price, which is $110.50, right?"

**Why it fails:** 85 words for ~32 seconds, states same thing three times, rhetorical questions add no value

**Example 3 (Over-explained):**
> "So that's the fundamental difference between risk and uncertainty. Risk is measurable - we can assign probabilities, we can model it, we can hedge it with derivatives. Uncertainty, on the other hand, involves unknown unknowns - we can't assign probabilities, and we need completely different strategies to deal with it. Make sure you understand this distinction, because it's going to be fundamental as we move through this course."

**Why it fails:** 67 words for 25+ seconds when 28 words would work, patronizing "make sure you understand"

### ✅ Calculation Examples (Step-by-Step Precision)

**Market Value Calculation - 15 words, 6 seconds:**
> "Market value equals stock price times shares: $70 times 1,000 equals $70,000."

**Margin Ratio Calculation - 22 words, 9 seconds:**
> "Margin ratio equals equity divided by market value: $25,000 divided by $60,000 equals 41.67%."

**Rate of Return - 28 words, 11 seconds:**
> "Rate of return equals ending equity minus initial equity, divided by initial equity: $25,000 minus $35,000, divided by $35,000, equals negative 28.57%."

## Special Handling

### Mathematical Concepts
**Do:**
- Walk through step-by-step
- Show the calculation with actual numbers
- Explain what each component means
- Verify the result makes sense

**Don't:**
- Just state the formula
- Skip intermediate steps
- Use variables without defining them

**Example:**
```
Good:
"So we calculate the margin ratio. Remember, it's equity divided by market value. 
Our equity is $25,000 - that's what we own. The market value is $60,000 - that's 
what the stock is worth. So $25,000 divided by $60,000 gives us 41.67%. Right? 
So our margin ratio is 41.67%."

Bad:
"The margin ratio is calculated as equity over market value, yielding 41.67%."
```

### Visual Descriptions
**Frame changes should be acknowledged:**
- "Now, if we look at this slide..."
- "Here you can see..."
- "Let me just bring up..."
- "If you look at the [left/right/top/bottom]..."

### Repetition for Emphasis
**Key concepts should be repeated 2-3 times in different ways:**
```
"So the key thing is equity. Equity is what you own. It's the market value 
minus what you borrowed. So equity = market value - borrowed amount. 
That's what belongs to you, that's your equity."
```

## Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Too Academic
- Avoid: "One must ascertain..."
- Use: "You need to figure out..."

### ❌ Too Passive
- Avoid: "It is calculated by..."
- Use: "You calculate it by..."

### ❌ Too Formal
- Avoid: "Subsequently, we shall examine..."
- Use: "So next, we'll look at..."

### ❌ Bullet Point Thinking
- Avoid: Listing points without connective tissue
- Use: Full narrative with transitions

### ❌ Jargon Without Definition
- Avoid: Using technical terms without explanation
- Use: Define first, then use term naturally

```

### Comparing Two Concepts
```
Template:
"So what's the difference between [A] and [B]? Well, with [A], [key feature]. 
But with [B], [contrasting feature]. Think about it this way: [analogy].
