# Slide Context: Risk vs Uncertainty - Understanding the Difference

**Concept:** Distinguishing between risk and uncertainty; Risk as measurable vs uncertainty as unmeasurable; Why the distinction matters in finance

**Key Takeaways:**
- Risk is quantifiable: Risk involves situations where we can assign probabilities to outcomes and model potential scenarios
- Uncertainty implies ignorance: Uncertainty involves unknown unknowns where we cannot assign reasonable probabilities to outcomes
- Management approaches differ: Financial risk can be managed through derivatives and hedging, while uncertainty requires different strategic approaches

## Famous Quotes

Here are 3 famous quotes about risk vs. uncertainty in finance from Warren Buffett, Frank Knight, and other notable figures:

1. **Warren Buffett on risk:**
   - Exact quote: *"Risk comes from not knowing what you are doing."*
   - Attribution: Warren Buffett
   - Source: Video titled "Warren Buffett Quotes Risk comes from not knowing what ..." on YouTube[3].

2. **Frank Knight on risk and uncertainty:**
   - Exact quote: *"Uncertainty must be taken in a sense radically distinct from the familiar notion of risk, from which it has never been properly separated... The essential fact is that 'risk' means in some cases a quantity susceptible of measurement, while at other times it is something distinctly not of this character."*
   - Attribution: Frank H. Knight, economist who distinguished risk (measurable probabilities) from uncertainty (unmeasurable)
   - Source: His 1921 book *Risk, Uncertainty and Profit* (classic economic text, widely cited in finance literature).

3. **John Maynard Keynes on uncertainty:**
   - Exact quote: *"By ‘uncertain’ knowledge, let me explain, I do not mean merely to distinguish what is known for certain from what is only probable. The sense in which I use the term is that in which the prospect of a European war is uncertain, or the price of copper and the rate of interest twenty years hence are uncertain, or the obsolescence of a new invention is uncertain."*
   - Attribution: John Maynard Keynes, economist
   - Source: *The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money* (1936), often cited in discussions of uncertainty in economics and finance.

These quotes highlight the critical distinction between **risk**—where probabilities are known or can be estimated—and **uncertainty**, where outcomes are fundamentally unknowable or not quantifiable, a key concept in investment decision-making. Buffett emphasizes understanding what you invest in to reduce risk, while Knight and Keynes clarify the conceptual difference between risk and uncertainty.

**Usage notes:** Use opening quote in Frame 1 to introduce the concept, and closing quote in final frame as memorable takeaway.

## Visual Suggestions

Here are 3 types of diagrams/visualizations that effectively explain **risk vs uncertainty**, including what they show, key elements, and how to recreate them simply:

---

### 1. **Comparison Chart: Known vs Unknown Outcomes**

**What it shows:**  
A side-by-side comparison illustrating the difference between *risk* (known probabilities of outcomes) and *uncertainty* (unknown or unknowable probabilities). This chart typically divides outcomes into categories such as:

- **Risk:** Outcomes with known probabilities (e.g., rolling a fair die, known odds).
- **Uncertainty:** Outcomes with unknown or poorly defined probabilities (e.g., unprecedented events, "black swan" events).

**Key elements:**  
- Two columns or areas labeled "Risk" and "Uncertainty"  
- Under "Risk," list examples with known probabilities and measurable consequences  
- Under "Uncertainty," list examples where probabilities are unknown or unknowable  
- Possibly include a visual scale or spectrum from "Known" to "Unknown"

**How to recreate:**  
- Use a simple two-column table or a Venn diagram with minimal overlap  
- Label columns clearly  
- Add icons or symbols (e.g., dice for risk, question mark or black swan silhouette for uncertainty)  
- Use text boxes to describe examples under each category

---

### 2. **Visual Metaphor: Dice for Risk, Black Swan for Uncertainty**

**What it shows:**  
A metaphorical illustration contrasting risk and uncertainty:

- **Dice:** Symbolizes risk because dice outcomes have known probabilities (e.g., 1/6 chance per face).  
- **Black Swan:** Represents uncertainty, referring to rare, unpredictable events with massive impact and unknown probabilities.

**Key elements:**  
- Image of dice with visible faces and numbers  
- Image or silhouette of a black swan, often depicted as dark or mysterious  
- Labels or captions explaining the metaphor  
- Possibly a dividing line or background gradient showing the transition from measurable risk to unknown uncertainty

**How to recreate:**  
- Draw a simple cube with dots representing dice faces  
- Sketch a black swan silhouette or use a simple bird shape shaded dark  
- Add arrows or text labels to explain the meaning  
- Use contrasting colors to differentiate the two concepts

---

### 3. **Diagram Showing Probability Distributions**

**What it shows:**  
Graphs that illustrate how risk involves known probability distributions (e.g., normal distribution, binomial distribution), while uncertainty involves unknown or poorly defined distributions.

- For **risk**, plot a clear probability distribution curve showing likelihood of outcomes.  
- For **uncertainty**, show a vague or multiple overlapping distributions, or a flat distribution indicating lack of knowledge.

**Key elements:**  
- X-axis: Possible outcomes  
- Y-axis: Probability or likelihood  
- Clear, smooth curve for risk (e.g., bell curve)  
- Blurred, wide, or multiple curves for uncertainty  
- Annotations explaining the certainty of probabilities in risk vs uncertainty

**How to recreate:**  
- Use graph paper or drawing tools to sketch axes  
- Draw a smooth bell-shaped curve for risk  
- Draw a shaded area or multiple faded curves to represent uncertainty  
- Label axes and add notes on probability knowledge

---

These visualizations are widely used in risk management and decision theory to clarify the distinction between measurable risks and unknown uncertainties. They can be easily created with basic drawing tools such as PowerPoint, Google Slides, or simple graphic software by combining shapes, icons, and text labels.  

No direct images were found in the search results, but these concepts align with standard explanations of risk and uncertainty as described in the Wikipedia risk entry and risk literature[1].

## Context & Definitions

**Frank Knight's 1921 definition and key insights:** In his seminal work *Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit* (1921), Frank Knight made a fundamental distinction between **risk** and **uncertainty**. He defined **risk** as situations where the probability of outcomes is *measurable* and can be quantified based on known distributions or historical data. In contrast, **uncertainty** refers to situations where the probabilities of outcomes are *not measurable* or cannot be reliably calculated because of lack of sufficient information or inherent unpredictability. Knight emphasized that risk is insurable and can be managed through calculation, while uncertainty is non-insurable and requires judgment and experience to handle[1][2][5].

**How portfolio managers distinguish between risk and uncertainty:** Portfolio managers typically treat **risk** as quantifiable variability in returns that can be modeled statistically (e.g., volatility, Value at Risk). They use historical data and probabilistic models to estimate the likelihood and impact of different outcomes. **Uncertainty**, however, arises when future states or probabilities are unknown or unknowable—such as unprecedented economic shocks or structural breaks in markets. Managers address uncertainty through scenario analysis, stress testing, and qualitative judgment rather than relying solely on quantitative models[2][3].

**Real-world examples:**

- **COVID-19 pandemic as uncertainty:** The onset of COVID-19 in early 2020 exemplified Knightian uncertainty because the virus’s impact, duration, and economic consequences were unknown and could not be probabilistically modeled at the time. This uncertainty challenged traditional risk models and required adaptive decision-making and judgment[2][3].

- **Market volatility as risk:** Daily fluctuations in stock prices, interest rates, or commodity prices represent risk because their probability distributions can be estimated from historical data. For example, the volatility of the S&P 500 index is a measurable risk that portfolio managers can hedge or diversify against[5].

**Common student misconceptions:**

- Confusing **risk** and **uncertainty** as synonymous terms, when Knight’s distinction is that risk involves *known probabilities* and uncertainty involves *unknown or unmeasurable probabilities*.

- Assuming all uncertainty can be converted into risk with enough data, ignoring that some events are fundamentally unpredictable or unprecedented (e.g., black swan events).

- Believing risk always implies negative outcomes, whereas risk includes both positive and negative potential consequences.

- Overreliance on quantitative models that assume risk but fail to capture uncertainty, leading to underestimation of rare or extreme events.

|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Risk**                   | Measurable probability of outcomes; quantifiable and insurable                               | Market volatility (e.g., S&P 500) | Knight (1921), Wikipedia[1][5] |
| **Uncertainty**            | Unmeasurable or unknown probabilities; non-insurable; requires judgment                      | COVID-19 pandemic impact         | Knight (1921), Sorenson & Stuart (2008)[2][3] |
| **Portfolio management**   | Uses statistical models for risk; scenario analysis and judgment for uncertainty             | Stress testing for unknown shocks | Practical finance literature[2][3] |
| **Student misconceptions** | Equating risk and uncertainty; ignoring unquantifiable uncertainty; viewing risk as only negative | Common in finance education      | Educational analyses[4]  |

This framework, first articulated by Knight in 1921, remains foundational in economics, finance, and decision theory, guiding how practitioners and scholars approach decision-making under different types of unknowns.

**Frame Integration:**
- Frame 2: Show Frank Knight's 1921 distinction as historical foundation
- Frame 4: Use COVID-19 example to illustrate true uncertainty
- Frame 6: Contrast insurance (works for risk) vs pandemic planning (uncertainty)
