1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,733
Here we'll look at risk versus
uncertainty. These terms aren't

2
00:00:04,303 --> 00:00:09,036
interchangeable - they're fundamentally
different. The left shows a probability

3
00:00:08,606 --> 00:00:14,199
distribution - that's risk. The right
shows a black swan - that's uncertainty.

4
00:00:14,643 --> 00:00:19,363
John Maynard Keynes, one of the most
influential economists of the 20th

5
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:21,923
century, had important insights about
uncertainty.

6
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:28,514
Keynes said: "By uncertain knowledge, I do
not mean merely to distinguish what is

7
00:00:28,117 --> 00:00:32,885
known for certain from what is only
probable." Uncertainty isn't just

8
00:00:32,487 --> 00:00:34,474
improbable - it's fundamentally
unknowable.

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:40,050
Keynes continues: "The sense in which I
use the term is that in which the prospect

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:45,070
of a European war is uncertain, or the
price of copper and the rate of interest

11
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,210
twenty years hence are uncertain."

12
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:51,870
Warren Buffett adds: "Risk comes from not
knowing what you are doing." Risk stems

13
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:57,030
from ignorance or lack of understanding.
These two perspectives define our

14
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,030
framework.

15
00:00:57,365 --> 00:01:03,457
Left side: Risk means known probability.
Right side: Uncertainty means unknown

16
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:09,043
probability. Rolling a standard six-sided
die demonstrates risk. Each outcome has

17
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:13,105
one-in-six probability. We can measure it
and assign probabilities.

18
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:19,524
Corporate bonds illustrate risk. Credit
ratings, historical default rates, and

19
00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:24,864
financial statements provide data. We
estimate default probabilities and model

20
00:01:24,324 --> 00:01:28,024
scenarios. Data makes it risk, not
uncertainty.

21
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:34,266
Car insurance premiums demonstrate
measurable risk. Actuarial tables allow

22
00:01:33,806 --> 00:01:38,186
insurance companies to assign
probabilities to different accident types

23
00:01:37,826 --> 00:01:44,586
using driver age, past accidents,
location, and vehicle type. Your insurer

24
00:01:43,766 --> 00:01:49,666
analyzes your profile against millions of
data points. They calculate precise

25
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:54,206
probabilities for your demographic. Known
probabilities mean measurable risk.

26
00:01:54,702 --> 00:02:01,638
Now uncertainty. Technological disruption
is the first example. Could anyone in 1995

27
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:06,440
predict smartphones would revolutionize
banking? Could you assign probabilities?

28
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:09,642
No - you couldn't imagine it coming.

29
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:16,104
COVID-19 demonstrates uncertainty
perfectly. Early 2020, no one could model

30
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:21,625
global lockdown probabilities or economic
impacts. This was unprecedented. Without

31
00:02:21,073 --> 00:02:27,146
historical data, we can't assign
meaningful probabilities. That's the core

32
00:02:26,594 --> 00:02:28,250
difference from risk.

33
00:02:28,543 --> 00:02:34,090
Regime changes in stable countries
represent uncertainty. A country stable

34
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:40,646
for decades - can you calculate regime
change probability? No. These are unique,

35
00:02:40,142 --> 00:02:42,663
one-off events without probability
distributions.

36
00:02:43,398 --> 00:02:50,720
Nassim Nicholas Taleb defined Black Swan
events. A Black Swan has three attributes:

37
00:02:50,197 --> 00:02:56,997
First, it's an outlier - outside regular
expectations. Second, it carries extreme

38
00:02:56,474 --> 00:03:02,227
impact. Third, despite being an outlier,
humans create explanations afterward,

39
00:03:01,704 --> 00:03:07,457
making it seem explainable and
predictable. After events happen, we

40
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:13,210
convince ourselves we could've predicted
them. But we couldn't. That's uncertainty.

41
00:03:12,687 --> 00:03:19,487
So risk is measurable - we assign
probabilities, model it, hedge with

42
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:24,717
derivatives. Uncertainty involves unknown
unknowns - we can't assign probabilities

43
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:28,378
and need different strategies. This
distinction is fundamental.
